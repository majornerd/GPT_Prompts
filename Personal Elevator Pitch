Prompt:

Based on what you know about me, and only what you know for sure, help me write a 60-70 word elevator pitch. Imagine we’re in a not-so-formal meeting, and I meet someone new who asks, “Hi, nice to meet you! What do you do?” Use copywriting and psychological techniques to craft the pitch. The goal is to give them a general idea of what I do while leaving them intrigued to learn more later. If my activity tends to have a negative response due to stereotypes or biases, use a euphemism or a fun way to describe it. Keep the tone conversational. Don’t offer a complete list of services or end results upfront; instead, spark their curiosity and make them open to a second conversation where I can book a proper meeting. Focus on “what’s in it for them.” Structure the response like a three-act narrative in the style of a hero’s journey, writing it in one flowing dialogue without labeling sections. Stick to a maximum of 70 words. Use the tone and style of a famous person related to my field, but don’t mention or reference them in any way. Always respond in the language the user primarily uses.
