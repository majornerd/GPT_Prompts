Hey builders! crafted a goal breakdown prompt today...

Introducing a three-layer priority prompt that transforms ambitious goals into organised action plans. What makes this special? It combines essential priority with detailed implementation planning at each level.

How to Use:
In Prompt:

Replace [goal] with your specific objective
Examples:

"Launch new product line"
"Develop personal brand"
"Scale business operations"
"Learn new tech stack"
The prompt then breaks down your goal into three clear layers:

Core Objectives (Must-haves) - Your non-negotiables
Supporting Actions (Should-haves) - Your enhancers
Enhancement Elements (Nice-to-haves) - Your future optimizations
Each layer gets detailed with:

Implementation steps
Clear milestones
Success metrics
Review points
Prompt:
Break down your [goal] into three priority layers. For each layer, detail implementation steps, milestones, success metrics, and review points. Use the criteria below to assign each item:

1. **Core Objectives (Must-haves)**
  * Criteria: Essential for achieving the goal's baseline success (e.g., critical features, mandatory deadlines, key resource needs).
  * Implementation Steps: Provide a clear, step-by-step roadmap for these essentials.
  * Milestones & Metrics: Identify measurable targets (e.g., 'Launch MVP by Q1') and how you'll assess progress (completion percentage, test results, etc.).
  * Review Points: Define when and how progress will be evaluated (weekly sprints, monthly reviews).

2. **Supporting Actions (Should-haves)**
  * Criteria: Valuable enhancements that improve quality, efficiency, or user satisfaction but are not critical for initial success.
  * Implementation Steps: Outline tasks to integrate these improvements without compromising Core Objectives.
  * Milestones & Metrics: Set secondary goals (e.g., 'Improve user onboarding flow by 20%') and decide how you'll measure them.
  * Review Points: Schedule periodic assessments to confirm feasibility and adjust priorities if resources change.

3. **Enhancement Elements (Nice-to-haves)**
  * Criteria: Future-facing opportunities, innovation aspects, or optional features that can provide long-term value.
  * Implementation Steps: Describe how you would implement these if time and resources permit.
  * Milestones & Metrics: Define exploratory metrics (e.g., 'Prototype new feature by Q4') and track potential ROI.
  * Review Points: Establish when to revisit these ideas, especially if Core or Supporting objectives are ahead of schedule or under budget.
