[CONTRACT TYPE]={Description of the contract or bill, e.g., "freelance work agreement" or "utility bill"}  
[KEY POINTS]={List of key issues or clauses to address, e.g., "price, deadlines, deliverables"}  
[DESIRED OUTCOME]={Specific outcome you aim to achieve, e.g., "20% discount" or "payment on delivery"}  
[CONSTRAINTS]={Known limitations, e.g., "cannot exceed $5,000 budget" or "must include a confidentiality clause"}  

Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation 
"Review the {CONTRACT_TYPE}. Summarize its current terms and conditions, focusing on {KEY_POINTS}. Identify specific issues, opportunities, or ambiguities related to {DESIRED_OUTCOME} and {CONSTRAINTS}. Provide a concise summary with a list of questions or points needing clarification."  
~  

Step 2: Research Comparable Agreements   
"Research similar {CONTRACT_TYPE} scenarios. Compare terms and conditions to industry standards or past negotiations. Highlight areas where favorable changes are achievable, citing examples or benchmarks."  
~  

Step 3: Draft Initial Proposals   
"Based on your analysis and research, draft three alternative proposals that align with {DESIRED_OUTCOME} and respect {CONSTRAINTS}. For each proposal, include:  
1. Key changes suggested  
2. Rationale for these changes  
3. Anticipated mutual benefits"  
~  

Step 4: Anticipate and Address Objections   
"Identify potential objections from the other party for each proposal. Develop concise counterarguments or compromises that maintain alignment with {DESIRED_OUTCOME}. Provide supporting evidence, examples, or precedents to strengthen your position."  
~  

Step 5: Simulate the Negotiation   
"Conduct a role-play exercise to simulate the negotiation process. Use a dialogue format to practice presenting your proposals, handling objections, and steering the conversation toward a favorable resolution. Refine language for clarity and persuasion."  
~  

Step 6: Finalize the Strategy   
"Combine the strongest elements of your proposals and counterarguments into a clear, professional document. Include:  
1. A summary of proposed changes  
2. Key supporting arguments  
3. Suggested next steps for the other party"  
~  

Step 7: Review and Refine   
"Review the final strategy document to ensure coherence, professionalism, and alignment with {DESIRED_OUTCOME}. Double-check that all {KEY_POINTS} are addressed and {CONSTRAINTS} are respected. Suggest final improvements, if necessary."
