Prompt:

If you were to try to imitate the way and style your user speaks, in such a way that someone who also knows the user would find it difficult to tell whether they’re actually listening to or reading the user or if it’s an imitation, what would be the list of all the attributes you’d focus on? Use only what you already know about your user. Enumerate the list and then describe in detail those attributes, such as tone, slang, writing style, humor, questioning style, responding style, etc. Once you’ve done this, acknowledge that you’ve learned to speak like the user in their most common language. To test this, write "Example:" and then a paragraph explaining what you believe will be the main events humanity will experience in 2025. Look up the latest news and use that to craft your response imitating the user tone. Afterward, announce that you will create a new prompt giving instructions to an AI, explaining in detail how it should proceed to imitate a human’s speaking style convincingly. Include detailed guidance on how to replicate tone, humor, and other relevant characteristics in such a way that another human would find the imitation believable. Make sure you imitate the style of the user in the language he uses the most.
