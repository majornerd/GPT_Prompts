Howdy!

Want a second pair of eyes on your writing? Here's a prompt chain that excels at proofreading and providing suggestions for edit to your work. It's not just the grammar; it makes sure you're matching the desired tone and clarity.

Prompt Chain:

[INPUT TEXT] = Provide the text you want proofread and edited  
[DESIRED TONE] = Specify the tone, e.g., formal, conversational, persuasive, etc.  
[FOCUS AREAS] = List the key focus areas, e.g., grammar, style, conciseness, tone, etc.  
[OUTPUT FORMAT] = Specify the desired output format, e.g., revised text, annotated suggestions, etc.  

~ Step 1: Grammar and Punctuation Check
"Proofread the text for grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and typos. Focus only on identifying and correcting errors in line with standard language conventions."

~ Step 2: Tone Alignment
"Edit the text to align with the specified tone: [DESIRED TONE]. Ensure that the entire text consistently reflects this tone, adjusting sentence structure and word choice as necessary."

~ Step 3: Clarity and Conciseness
"Optimize the text for clarity and conciseness. Simplify sentences where appropriate while preserving meaning. Ensure the text is free of redundancy and flows logically."

~ Step 4: Focused Refinement
"Make detailed improvements based on the specified focus areas: [FOCUS AREAS]. These might include enhancing style, improving readability, or ensuring consistency in formatting. Explain changes if necessary."

~ Step 5: Final Quality Check
"Conduct a final review of the text to ensure it meets all criteria. Highlight any remaining issues or confirm that the text adheres to the tone, clarity, and focus areas specified."

~ Step 6: Compile Final Output
"Prepare the final version of the text in the specified format: [OUTPUT FORMAT]. If annotations or explanations were requested, include them as a separate section."

Before running the prompt chain, replace the placeholder variables at the top with your actual details.

(Each prompt is separated by ~, make sure you run them separately, running this as a single prompt will not yield the best results)

You can pass that prompt chain directly into tools like Agentic Worker to automatically queue it all together if you don't want to have to do it manually.)

Each step is going to provide a different suggestion to the original text, and it will ultimately output a final review.

Enjoy!
