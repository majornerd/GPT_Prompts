</writing style>
Quick breakdown of the prompt: The first two bullet points are the main drivers of getting to natural output. It gets rid of the clunky, long sentences and the complex words. Sometimes a ‘elevate’ or ‘delve’ might slip through, but that is something you can quickly fix without rewriting everything. Avoiding adverbs, the passive voice, and buzzwords is a pretty standard rule within business writing and copywriting. They are often redundant and only make your writing weaker. 

I also asked ‘use jargon’ where relevant, but don’t mistake it for buzzwords. For example if you are writing a business email about the impact of AI, it can mistake AI for jargon. If you say to avoid jargon it can replace AI for ‘super smart computers’ which makes your writing childish.  The last point is to get rid of that annoying politeness or enthusiasm that sounds fake and a bit too eager.
